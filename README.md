TLC Trip Record Data

Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pickup and drop-off dates/times, pickup and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.
